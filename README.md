# piEQ

The purpose of piEQ is to enable listeners to apply flexible parametric equalization to any audio source with intuitive control via a web interface.

This is the development branch for the "portable" version of piEQ, which packages all components of the software into a cross-platform application that can be used in conjunction with inter-application audio software (e.g. [VB-Audio Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) for Windows or [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) for Mac) to apply equalization to audio from any application.
